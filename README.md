# GettingCleanningDataProject
Peer Assignment of the Getting and Cleanning Data from the Data Science Course

In addition to this Readme file, the repository contains other files:
1. run_analysis.R: contains the code of the assignment
2. tidydata.txt: the output file resulting from the previous file 
3. Code_book.md: contains the codes needed to understand the contents of the previous file


The script "run_analysis.R" files executes the following R code:

0. Load the used libraries and download the original dataset and information files
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
average of each variable for each activity and each subject. A file is writen called "Final_data.txt".
